# Procedural City Generation

This project is writen in c++ and uses sfml. It is aimed to generate cities fast and legitimately. Currently only some basic works have been done, like generating road network. I might export this to a game engine for further development in the future. 

## Installation

This project is build with cmake. Download source code and build on your own machine with cmake, and you are good to go.

## Algorithm

The algorithm of procedural generation comes from [this web page](https://www.tmwhere.com/city_generation.html)
